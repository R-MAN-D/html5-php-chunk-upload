# html5-php-chunk-upload
Chunk file uploading by the use of HTML5, PHP, JavaScript, and CSS.

# What is chunk file uploading?
This is simply the process of of breaking down a file into smaller parts called chunk/s then uploading
each chunks of the file starting from the very first until the very last chunk.
This is done instead of uploading a whole file at once.

# Why chunk upload?
This is by far the best thing to do when uploading files with large sizes.
In chunk upload, we aim to solve problems / issues like "Browser limitations", "Server configuration issues", and
"Timeout issues".
